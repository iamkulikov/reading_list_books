## Основные идеи

1. We must all take responsibility for our limited understanding of economic phenomena, our desire to believe what we want to believe, our relative intellectual laziness, and our cognitive biases.

2. Departures from laissez-faire economics are often needed to capture the benefits of the market. Market must not trivialize some goods ans services (because of the percieved immorality of buying and selling some things), but regulation is often an answer. Market failure is often confused with the moral limits of the market. The regulation or prohibition of a market can be a response to a problem of information (monetization of good destroys its value by altering meaning), externality or an internality (behavior of an individual conflicts with his own future interest).

1. Even so, the market economy has achieved only partial victory, because it has won neither hearts or minds.

2. Around the world, the supremacy of the market is regarded with widespread distrust, sometimes accepted only with an outrage laced with fatalism.

3. Three kinds of writing about economics (Paul Krugman): greek-letter (models), up-down (short-term problems) and airport (about everything at once).

4. The carryover effect (leakage problem) - activities tend to migrate to places with more lemient regulation.

5. The bias toward identifiable victim. In medicine secondary effects usually affect those who are treated. In economics - usually others are affected.

6. Markets protect ordinary people from lobbying and favoritism. Such abuses in more centralized systems contribute to the revolutionary movements. 

7. Public policymakers usually don't have enough information to manually distribute goods. There is a confusion between what they can do and what they want to do. 

8. Examples of public policy which correct market failures: competition law, sectoral and prudential regulation, taxes on environmental externalities, fees to reduce traffic, monetary policy and financial stabilization, mechanisms for providing "merit goods" such as education and healthcare, income redistribution.

8. When the flame of indignation burns brightly, people use moral arguments to impose their own value judgements and reduce the freedom of others. Who is the victim? What is the basis of yor belief? Can anything other than your own indignation justify infringing the freedom of others?

9. Tossing or catapulting little people was prohibited (France - 1995, Florida - 1989), because it affects not only those who consented but also the image of others.

10. Who would really regret the disappearance of the strongest social bonds that have ever existed: those between a slave and his master, between a wife and her all-powered husband, between a worker and a monopsonistic employer, or - to return to a lighter example - the bond between our villager and his not very talented baker?
