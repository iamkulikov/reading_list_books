## Основные идеи

1. We must all take responsibility for our limited understanding of economic phenomena, our desire to believe what we want to believe, our relative intellectual laziness, and our cognitive biases.

2. Departures from laissez-faire economics are often needed to capture the benefits of the market. Market must not trivialize some goods ans services (because of the percieved immorality of buying and selling some things), but regulation is often an answer. Market failure is often confused with the moral limits of the market. The regulation of a market can be a response to a problem of information (monetization of good destroys its value by altering meaning), externality or an internality (behavior of an individual conflicts with his own future interest), as well as prohibition. 

3. Economists in different guises are surrounded by dangers of loosing integrity because of conflict of interest.

4. Research in economics is based on back and forth movement between theory and experience, methodology and applications, evaluation of papers, evolving consensus after a debate, mathematics (to provide language and check applicability) and new conceptual tools (information theory and game theory). Interdisciplinary research remains an important source of progress even though specialization is inevitable.

5. There are lots of empirically established behavior patterns which make real people different from Homo Economicus. At least: procrastination (short-termism), mistakes in estimating risk, empathy (internalizing well-being of others), self-image matters, homo socialis (group perception may affect individual behavior), e.t.c. The reunification of social sciences happen.

6. Although one of the government's roles is to fight market failures, state itself has some failure like being captured by special interests at the expense of the collective interest, having reelection as a primary goal etc. With some stretch market and government correct each others failures. Independent agencies are needed to isolate long-term goals and policies from the electoral cycle. When markets are failing, the modern state regulates. It assumes the responsibility for creating equality and opportunity, healthy competition, and a financial system not dependent on bailouts using public money. It finds a way of making economic actors act responsibly with regard to environment, of establishing equality in health insurance coverage, of ensuring protection for employees who do not have an information that would empower them. In its operations it is nimble and reactive. Reforms of the state are possible.

7. Investor ownership and control are widespread around the world because they win the competition. Corporate social responsibility, socially responsible investment, and fair trade are compatible with a market economy. They represent a response that is both decentralized and partial (because of the free rider problem) to the question of how to provide certain public goods. There will be less of that if the state was truly benevolent and effective.

8. Climate policy failures are the tragedy of commons: economic agents do not internalize the damage they cause by emitting GHGs. The green imperative will be respected if the economic imperative is also respected. Both require a global approach and a pricing mechanism.

1. Even so, the market economy has achieved only partial victory, because it has won neither hearts or minds.

2. Around the world, the supremacy of the market is regarded with widespread distrust, sometimes accepted only with an outrage laced with fatalism.

3. Three kinds of writing about economics (Paul Krugman): greek-letter (models), up-down (short-term problems) and airport (about everything at once).

4. The carryover effect (leakage problem) - activities tend to migrate to places with more lenient regulation.

5. The bias toward identifiable victim. In medicine secondary effects usually affect those who are treated. In economics - usually others are affected.

6. Markets protect ordinary people from lobbying and favoritism. Such abuses in more centralized systems contribute to the revolutionary movements. 

7. Public policymakers usually don't have enough information to manually distribute goods. There is a confusion between what they can do and what they want to do. 

8. Examples of public policy which correct market failures: competition law, sectoral and prudential regulation, taxes on environmental externalities, fees to reduce traffic, monetary policy and financial stabilization, mechanisms for providing "merit goods" such as education and healthcare, income redistribution.

8. When the flame of indignation burns brightly, people use moral arguments to impose their own value judgements and reduce the freedom of others. Who is the victim? What is the basis of your belief? Can anything other than your own indignation justify infringing the freedom of others?

9. Tossing or catapulting little people was prohibited (France - 1995, Florida - 1989), because it affects not only those who consented but also the image of others.

10. Who would really regret the disappearance of the strongest social bonds that have ever existed: those between a slave and his master, between a wife and her all-powered husband, between a worker and a monopsonistic employer, or - to return to a lighter example - the bond between our villager and his not very talented baker?

11. ... the market is sometimes made a scapegoat for our own hypocrisy. Even when it neither strengthens nor weakens our social bonds, the market becomes a mirror to our souls that reflects realities of our societies, facets of our aspirations, and preferences that we would rather conceal - from ourselves as well as others.

12. ... beliefs about what determines income and wealth, which clearly affect the choices made about taxation and social protection, are in part endogenous. (US - 30% believe that success is due to chance, Europeans - 54%).

13. This is the world of "self-fulfilling prophecies" and "multiple equilibria"...

14. About training in economics, which may change behaviour. All these influences create narratives that, however valid empirically provide (weak) excuses for less ethical behavior.

15. Greek poet Archilochus: "The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog know one big thing".

16. Brief introduction to contract theory. The contract has to be founded on a set of credible rewards and punishments. It also need to be flexible enough to reflect changing information, notably becuase things will inevitably occur could not be predicted at the time the contract was signed. Thus, methods for renegotiating or even breaking the contract must be provided, notably exit options and rules for calculating indemnities. Finally, in the absence of formal incentive mechanisms, trade must rely on a more informal relationship between the two parties, in which the repetition of poor performance by one makes the other suspicious and leads to a loss of confidence and cooperation.

17. Societies that involve a high level of exchange (and thus do not have a way of life centered on the family) seem to be more cooperative in experiments with reciprocal altruism. "In search of homo economicus: behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale economies".

18. Altruism is fragile. Some people tend to not get in the situation, where they may be forced to be "good" by their future self. 

19. Short-termism may be explained by the fact that we feel pain and pleasure even before the actual experience. Therefore lack of concern and mistakes in risk assessment may lead to happier (but shorter) life. 

20. Defending the collective reputation entails an entirely private cost but a benefit that is shared by the whole community. This is why there is tendency toward free-riding.

21. Loss of reputation by the society may be self-fulfilling.

22. Nice classification of market failure causes: externalities, exchange without full knowledge and consent, buyers become victims of their own actions, exchabge may exceed individual capacities (when continuous relation needs monitoring, for example), excessive market power, market may generate excessive inequality.

23. Example of Sweden's downscaling of the government in the 90s: public expenditure down by 10 pps of GDP, government officials down from 400000 to 250000.

24. The mode of organization we observe is therefore the result of competition between different governance models (if this competition is not distorted by fiscal or regulatory incentives favoring a particular form). So we might be surprised that economic activity is overwhelmingly organized around firms that entrust supervisory rights to a single stakeholder - the investors, to whom the management is  formally accountable.

25. Examples of capitalist management dysfunctions: tenuous connection between company's performance and the remuneration of its managers, cases of dividends being paid shortly before declaring bankruptcy, accounting manipulations, short-term thinking to the detriment of long-term profitability, and insider trading.

26. A professional services company like KPMG is composed essentially of human capital, and can operate as a cooperative, whereas the companies with greatest need for finance will tend to give control to their investors.

27. Clawback provision specifies that any reward that has been given out may be returned in special circumstances.

28. Economic policy is distorted by what is visible and what is not so visible.

29. The enthusiasm for top-down approaches (uniform reductions, limits and standards in climate policy) originates in governments's desire to appear to be doing to tackle climate change.

30. 


## Мои идеи

1. "Коллективное" решение для всех Я из разных времен. Нужен механизм!

2. Общества с меньшими размерами семей проявляют меньше доверия и альтруизма к "внешним" не только из-за бедности? 

3. "Irrelevant alternatives" всегда влияют - это контекст.
